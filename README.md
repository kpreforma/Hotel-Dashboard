# Hotel-Dashboard
This is a guided project showing the resulting files when building a simple database in Microsoft Azure SQL Database with the use of SQL Management Studio. This demostrates the SQL queries necessary to build the output dashboard in Power BI Desktop.

Note: This is a guided project based on the [Data Analyst Portfolio Project #1 Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2zBHmkRbhY) by Absent Data from Youtube. I performed majority of the steps in the video. Some processes are done to achieve the desired output performed different from the video. 

The sample dashboard is shown below:

The data used in the project was from Kaggle: [Hotel Revenue Dataset](https://absentdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/hotel_revenue_historical_full-2.xlsx).
